Getting Started
=================

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- Npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.

- [FaunaDB](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/learn/quick_start/quick_start) this is where we store the image information, all you need to do is create a database in FaunaDB with a name of your choice that needs to have a collection of images:

1. Copy the bank key to the file `.env.local` this way:
2. `FAUNA_API_KEY=VALUE`

- [ImgBB](https://api.imgbb.com) this is where we easily store the images, and to work correctly, follow the steps:

1. Create an account on ImgBB;
2. Create your API key;
3. Copy the key value and paste in your `.env.local` this way:

4. `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMGBB_API_KEY=VALUE`
